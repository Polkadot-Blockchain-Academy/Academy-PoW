A Proof of Work blockchain node for use in the Polkadot Blockchain Academy.
It happens to be based on Substrate, but no Substrate knowledge is required.
Students will use this node to start their own network, perform hard and soft forks, and execute smart contracts.

Instructors, planning to host such an activity should see the docs on [setting up a bootnode](./SettingUpTheBootnode.md).

## Building the Node

First you will need a [Substrate developer environment](https://docs.substrate.io/install/).

1. Cloning this repo
2. Running `cargo build --release`

## More Help

This code will be used primarily as an in-class activity that is instructor led, so just wait for details in class.
