# Workflow inspired by https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images

# This is currently somewhat redundant with the docker stuff in e2e-tests-suite.yml
# This one is nice because it publishes the docker image to a registry so that students can
# easily download it to their local systems or their servers. Ideally those e2e tests would be able
# to use this same docker container somehow.
